###### `01:00 – 02:00pm` Active Study &ndash; Part 2

This is a workshop offered by [Rachel Brunson](https://myusf.usfca.edu/lwsc/staff), Assistant Director with the [Learning Center](https://myusf.usfca.edu/learning-center). The workshop description is:

> Students have many different approaches to learning and studying. It is important to recognize and build upon the active study skills that work best for you and will help lead you to academic success. This workshop builds off of the tools provided in "Active Study – Part I" and walks you through a personal exploration of higher-order thinking skills (Bloom’s Taxonomy) in order to increase awareness and understanding of your own thought processes (metacognition) and learning styles/preferences. This workshop also discusses the assess stage of "The Study Cycle" in more depth than Part I.
