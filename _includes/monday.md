###### `03:30 – 04:15pm` Computer Hardware

We will have a presentation on computer hardware by [Elias Husary](https://www.usfca.edu/faculty/elias-husary), System Administrator with our [CS Support](https://myusf.usfca.edu/arts-sciences/computer-science/technical-resources) group.

###### `04:15 – 04:45pm` Using Unix

We will cover how to use a Unix-based operating system using the CS lab computers available in the LS G12 classroom. Students will login to their CS lab accounts, learn about file systems, and how to use the command line (or terminal) in Unix to navigate and execute code.

There are many other resources for learning how to use the command line in Linux. Here are a few:

- [**Using Linux via Command Line**](http://tutoringcenter.cs.usfca.edu/resources/using-linux-via-command-line.html) *by CS Tutoring Center*  
Free online walkthrough offered by the CS Tutoring Center. Check out the [CS Tutoring Center](http://tutoringcenter.cs.usfca.edu/resources/) for other resources, like how to login remotely to the CS Lab computers.

- [**A Quick Introduction to Unix**](https://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/A_Quick_Introduction_to_Unix) *by Wikibooks*  
A free open-source online collaborative textbook presented as a wiki.

- [**Learn the Command Line**](https://www.codecademy.com/learn/learn-the-command-line ) *by Codecademy*  
An interactive online course. Some content requires a subscription, but the free content is enough to learn the basics.

- [**Introduction to the Command Line**](https://launchschool.com/books/command_line) *by Launch School*  
A free book made to supplement their paid course content, but useful standalone.

- [**Learning Linux Command Line**](https://www.linkedin.com/learning/learning-linux-command-line-2) *on LinkedIn Learning*  
Online video-based course. [LinkedIn Learning](https://myusf.usfca.edu/ets/educational-technologies/lynda) is a free resource for USF students; requires login.

This lesson will be continued on Tuesday.

###### `04:45 – 05:00pm` Baseline Survey

All participants received an email with the subject "2019-20 USF S-STEM Baseline Survey" from smartstart-er.com, our external evaluator for this program. If you have not yet completed the survey, please do so now. It is important to complete this survey *before* you have gone through the majority of activities for this week.

Remember, we must have our program evaluated as a condition of our funding. This survey is used to evaluate our program, not you.

###### `05:00 – 06:00pm` *Dinner*

Students are encouraged to eat on campus using their meal plans or dons dollars. See the [dining](dining.html) page for details.
