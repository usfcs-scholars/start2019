> While every student is different and has a unique pathway towards success, all students have at least one thing in common: there are 168 hours in each week to manage and plan for important commitments and priorities. Students bring with them a broad array of circumstances and obligations, making time management and prioritization essential. This workshop will provide tips and strategies to assist you in planning ahead in order to enhance your ability to make the most out of each week within the semester, as well as enabling you to reach consistent personal and academic success during your college years.
