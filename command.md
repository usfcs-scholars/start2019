Use what you have learned to discover the correct hidden poem! It is hidden somewhere on the CS lab computers at:

```
/home/sjengle/hunt
```

You should first attempt to discover the hidden poem on your own.

Once you have discovered the answer, show the instructor and collect your sugary reward!

The first students to finish get first pick at the candy. However... the first five students to collect their reward will be asked to help out the other students!

Helpers: always let the student you are helping do the typing, and do not say the answer aloud! Help them discover the answer by giving hints on commands to try.

Students: if you do not finish before dinner, do not fret! The CS Tutoring Center is hosting the first social and can help you out.
