## Welcome Reception

We will provide coffee, tea, and breakfast pastries for the welcome reception on Monday for all participants. Breakfast will not be provided for the rest of the week.

## Lunch and Dinner

While we do not have funding to provide lunch or dinner during the head start program, students will be use the [on-campus dining halls](https://www.usfca.edu/student-life/campus-experience/dining-campus). Visit the [Bon App√©tit website](https://www.usfca.edu/student-life/campus-experience/dining-campus) for menus and locations.

Students with [flexi meal plans](https://myusf.usfca.edu/housing/meal-plans) will be able to use them during the head start week. Otherwise, students are encouraged to use [dons dollars](https://www.usfca.edu/one-card/students/don-dollars) to purchase meals on campus.

Students may also grab food [off-campus](https://www.yelp.com/search?find_desc=Restaurants&find_loc=2130%20Fulton%20St%2C%20San%20Francisco%2C%20CA&l=g%3A-122.44322776760254%2C37.78038134703312%2C-122.45601654018554%2C37.77020501300874) or bring their own meals (limited refrigeration is available).
