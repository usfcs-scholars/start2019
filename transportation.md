We will be located in the [John Lo Schiavo, S.J. Center for Science and Innovation](https://www.usfca.edu/campus-buildings-services/main-campus/lo-schiavo) building (commonly abbreviated as "Lo Schiavo Science" or just "LS") in room G12. This is a dedicated CS classroom with lab computers available to students without laptops.

  <div class="column">
    <p>The LS G12 classroom is located on the "garden level" of <a href="https://www.usfca.edu/campus-buildings-services/main-campus/lo-schiavo">Lo Schiavo Science</a>. The classroom can be tricky to find your first time, as it is located <strong>partially underground</strong> and <strong>physically separated</strong> from the rest of the <a href="https://www.usfca.edu/campus-buildings-services/main-campus/lo-schiavo">Lo Schiavo Science</a> building. If you see a grass lawn with a <a href="http://sffoghorn.com/verbiests-ecliptic-armillary-sphere-much-more-than-just-a-sculpture/">dragon sculpture/armillary sphere</a> on top, you are in the right area (see photo). That is the green roof of the LS G12 classroom.</p>

    <p>To get there, find the entrance going down to the garden level between <a href="https://www.usfca.edu/campus-buildings-services/main-campus/lo-schiavo">Lo Schiavo Science</a> and the <a href="https://www.usfca.edu/campus-buildings-services/main-campus/university-center">University Center</a>. Look for the classroom with the green glass wall underneath the <a href="http://sffoghorn.com/verbiests-ecliptic-armillary-sphere-much-more-than-just-a-sculpture/">dragon sculpture</a>.</p>

    <p>You can also find the classroom entrance using the <a href="https://map.concept3d.com/?id=924#!m/160033">campus map</a>.</p>

    <p class="is-size-7 has-text-grey">CAPTION: In the photo, <a href="https://www.usfca.edu/campus-buildings-services/main-campus/lo-schiavo">Lo Schiavo Science</a> is the glass building on the left. The beige building in the back is <a href="https://www.usfca.edu/campus-buildings-services/main-campus/harney-science">Harney Science Center</a>. On the right but <em>not</em> depicted is the <a href="https://www.usfca.edu/campus-buildings-services/main-campus/university-center">University Center</a> building. The <a href="http://sffoghorn.com/verbiests-ecliptic-armillary-sphere-much-more-than-just-a-sculpture/">dragon sculpture/armillary sphere</a> is shown in the front-left. That grass lawn is the green roof of the LS G12 classroom. The pathway on the right going down leads to the garden level of <a href="https://www.usfca.edu/campus-buildings-services/main-campus/lo-schiavo">Lo Schiavo Science</a> and the entrance of the classroom.</p>

We will be using [**public transportation**](https://www.sfmta.com/) to visit the [Exploratorium](https://www.exploratorium.edu/visit/location-directions) and [Autodesk Gallery](https://www.autodesk.com/gallery/visit-us) in downtown San Francisco for our field trip.

All undergraduate students are eligible for a free [SF Muni pass](https://myusf.usfca.edu/public-safety-transportation/transportation/public-transportation), which allows students to take any of the busses, subways, street cars, and cable cars operated by [SF Muni](https://www.sfmta.com/fares/lifeline-pass) (San Francisco <u>Muni</u>cipal Railway) for free. We are working to have these passes available in time for use on the field trip.
