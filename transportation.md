We will be located in the [John Lo Schiavo, S.J. Center for Science and Innovation](https://www.usfca.edu/campus-buildings-services/main-campus/lo-schiavo) building (commonly abbreviated as "Lo Schiavo Science" or just "LS") in room G12. This is a dedicated CS classroom with lab computers available to students without laptops.

The LS G12 classroom is located on the "garden level" of Lo Schiavo Science. The classroom can be tricky to find your first time, as it is located partially underground and physically separated from the rest of the Lo Schiavo Science building. If you see a grass lawn with a [dragon sculpture/armillary sphere](http://sffoghorn.com/verbiests-ecliptic-armillary-sphere-much-more-than-just-a-sculpture/) on top, you are in the right area (see above).

To get there, find the entrance to the garden level between [Lo Schiavo Science](https://www.usfca.edu/campus-buildings-services/main-campus/lo-schiavo) and the [University Center](https://www.usfca.edu/campus-buildings-services/main-campus/university-center). Look for the classroom with the green glass wall underneath the [dragon sculpture](http://sffoghorn.com/verbiests-ecliptic-armillary-sphere-much-more-than-just-a-sculpture/). You can find the entrance using the [campus map](https://map.concept3d.com/?id=924#!m/160033) or on the Google map below:
